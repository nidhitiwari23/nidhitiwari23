## 🔎 Overview

**AI Meeting Intelligence System** is an end-to-end, **100% free and open-source** platform that behaves like an AI project coordinator sitting in on your meetings. It listens, transcribes, understands the discussion, extracts decisions and action items, schedules follow-ups, notifies your team, and remembers everything — so you can ask it questions about any past meeting, anytime.

It's built as a **portfolio-grade project**: real multi-agent orchestration, real RAG, real speech AI, real integrations — no mocked-out pieces, and no paid API keys required to run it.

---

## 🚩 The Problem

In almost every company, the same pattern repeats after every meeting:

| Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|
| 📝 Someone manually takes notes | Half-listening, half-writing, error-prone |
| 🤐 Decisions are only spoken, never logged | Forgotten within days |
| 📌 Action items aren't written down | Nobody remembers who promised what |
| ⏱️ Manager writes minutes by hand | 30–60 minutes wasted after every meeting |
| 🔍 No way to search past meetings | "What did we decide about X?" → nobody knows |

None of this needs exotic technology — it's a **workflow automation problem**. The information already exists in the meeting audio. It just isn't captured, structured, or distributed automatically. That's exactly what this system does.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[🎙️ Meeting Happens] --> B{How was it captured?}
    B -->|Recorded file| C[📤 Upload Video/Audio]
    B -->|Live meeting| D[🔴 Local System-Audio Capture]
    C --> E[🤖 AI Meeting Intelligence System]
    D --> E
    E --> F[📝 Summary]
    E --> G[✅ Decisions]
    E --> H[📌 Action Items + Priority]
    E --> I[📅 Calendar Invite]
    E --> J[📧 Email / Slack Summary]
    E --> K[🧠 Searchable Meeting Memory]

    style E fill:#4F46E5,color:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style A fill:#0EA5E9,color:#fff
    style K fill:#16A34A,color:#fff
```

Instead of a human manually producing all six outputs on the right, one system produces all of them automatically, within minutes of the meeting ending.

## 🏗️ High-Level System Design

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph INPUT["🎧 INPUT LAYER"]
        direction LR
        UP[Uploaded Recording]
        LIVE[Live System-Audio Capture]
    end

    subgraph SPEECH["🗣️ SPEECH PROCESSING"]
        direction LR
        WH[Whisper<br/>Speech → Text]
        DZ[pyannote.audio<br/>Speaker Diarization]
        WH --> DZ
    end

    subgraph AGENTS["🤖 LANGGRAPH MULTI-AGENT PIPELINE"]
        direction TB
        SUM[Summarizer Agent]
        DEC[Decision Agent]
        ACT[Action Item Agent]
        PRI[Task Assignment Agent]
        CAL[Calendar Agent]
        EMA[Email / Slack Agent]
        SUM --> DEC --> ACT --> PRI --> CAL --> EMA
    end

    subgraph STORE["💾 STORAGE"]
        direction LR
        SQL[(SQLite<br/>Meetings · Tasks · Decisions)]
        VEC[(ChromaDB<br/>Vector Memory)]
    end

    subgraph APP["🖥️ APPLICATION LAYER"]
        direction LR
        API[FastAPI Backend]
        UI[Streamlit Frontend]
        API <--> UI
    end

    subgraph OUT["🔗 INTEGRATIONS"]
        direction LR
        GC[Google Calendar]
        GM[Gmail]
        SL[Slack]
    end

    INPUT --> SPEECH --> AGENTS
    AGENTS --> SQL
    AGENTS --> VEC
    AGENTS --> GC
    AGENTS --> GM
    AGENTS --> SL
    SQL --> API
    VEC --> API

    style INPUT fill:#0EA5E9,color:#fff
    style SPEECH fill:#F59E0B,color:#111
    style AGENTS fill:#4F46E5,color:#fff
    style STORE fill:#16A34A,color:#fff
    style APP fill:#DB2777,color:#fff
    style OUT fill:#6B7280,color:#fff
```

**Why it's layered this way:** each layer is independently swappable. Whisper could be replaced with another STT engine, SQLite could become Postgres, ChromaDB could become a hosted vector DB — none of that would require touching the agent logic.

## 🧩 Multi-Agent Architecture

Every agent has exactly **one job** and reads/writes to a single shared `MeetingState`, orchestrated by LangGraph:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T([📄 Transcript]) --> S1

    S1[["🧾 Summarizer Agent<br/><i>Clean, &lt;150-word summary</i>"]] --> S2
    S2[["✅ Decision Agent<br/><i>Extracts firm decisions</i>"]] --> S3
    S3[["📌 Action Item Agent<br/><i>Who promised what, by when</i>"]] --> S4
    S4[["🔺 Task Assignment Agent<br/><i>Adds High/Medium/Low priority</i>"]] --> S5
    S5[["📅 Calendar Agent<br/><i>Detects + creates follow-up event</i>"]] --> S6
    S6[["📧 Email/Slack Agent<br/><i>Drafts + sends team summary</i>"]] --> R

    R([📦 Final Meeting Report])

    classDef agent fill:#EEF2FF,stroke:#4F46E5,stroke-width:2px,color:#1E1B4B
    class S1,S2,S3,S4,S5,S6 agent
```

> 💬 **A question you'll get in interviews:** *"Why not run these in parallel?"* — Summarizer, Decision, and Action-Item agents don't depend on each other's output, so they *could* fan out from a single node and merge before Task Assignment. This project runs them sequentially for simplicity/debuggability today; parallelizing them is a natural next optimization (see [Roadmap](#-roadmap)).

Separately, a **RAG Agent** gives the system long-term memory:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q([❓ "What did Bob promise last month?"]) --> EMB[Embed Question]
    EMB --> SEARCH[(ChromaDB<br/>Semantic Search)]
    SEARCH --> CTX[Top-K Relevant<br/>Transcript Chunks]
    CTX --> LLM[LLM answers<br/>using ONLY retrieved context]
    LLM --> ANS([💬 Cited Answer])

    style Q fill:#0EA5E9,color:#fff
    style SEARCH fill:#16A34A,color:#fff
    style ANS fill:#4F46E5,color:#fff
```

## 🎥 Two Ways To Use It

| Mode | How | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 📤 **Upload a recording** | Upload `.mp3/.wav/.m4a/.mp4` in the Streamlit UI | ✅ Fully working |
| 🔴 **Live meeting** | Run `live_capture/record_system_audio.py` while you're in the call, stop it when the meeting ends | ✅ Working via free system-audio capture (not an official platform bot — see full guide for why) |

- [ ] Parallelize independent agents (Summarizer / Decision / Action-Item) for faster processing
- [ ] Switch to `faster-whisper` for 3–4x faster CPU transcription
- [ ] Automatic real-name speaker mapping (voice enrollment)
- [ ] Direct Jira / GitHub ticket creation from meeting mentions
- [ ] Real-time streaming transcription during live capture
